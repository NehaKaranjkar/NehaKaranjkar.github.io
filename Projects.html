<h2>Current Research Areas</h2>
<h3>Approches and Frameworks for Parallel Discrete-event and Cycle Based Simulation</h3>
<p><b>Sitar (Simulation Tool for Architectural Research)</b><br />

<a href="https://github.com/sitar-sim/sitar/">[Project GitHub Repo]</a><br /></p>
<p>Sitar is a framework for modeling and parallel simulation of synchronous discrete-event systems (such as discrete
time queues, computer networks and computer architectural models). It consists of a
system description language and a cycle-based simulation kernel that uses a unique, easy-to-parallelize
two-phase execution approach. The language allows a system to be described in 
a hierarchical manner as an interconnection of modules
running concurrently. The behavior of each module can be described in an imperative
manner using constructs such as time-delays, conditional wait statements, fork-join
concurrency, and branch/loop constructs. C++ code can be embedded in a module
description in a straightforward and well-defined manner. The sitar language parser
has been written using Antlr V3. The simulation kernel is lightweight, consisting of a
small set of C++ classes, and has been parallelized using OpenMP. 
Sitar received the best paper award at SIMULTECH2022 conference.</p>

<h3>Approches for efficient simulation of Hybrid (mixed discrete-event and continuous) systems</h3>
<p>We are developing efficient approaches and open frameworks for hybrid simulation of systems containing loosely coupled
discrete-event and continuous processes (such as those in process simulation applications).
A preliminary version of the framework is described in <a href="./publications/NehaKaranjkarSubodhJoshi_LNNS.pdf">this paper</a>.</p>

<h3>Approaches and Tools for Automated Model Generation</h3>
<p>We are developing approaches and building tools for automated model generation.<br />
As one component of this flow, we have built an open, cloud-hosted tool called <a href="">DataFITR</a> 
for guided input modeling and random variate generation.</p>

<h3>Open libraries for Simulation and Design exploration of Supply Chain Networks</h3>
<p>We are developing an open Python library for the simulation of inventory and supply chain networks, coupled with meta-model based design exploration tool-sets.</p>
<h2>Past Projects</h2>
<h3>IoT End-Point Simulation Framework for at-scale testing of middlewares and applications</h3>
<p>This was a project at RBCCPS (IISc Bangalore) with the aim 
of developing a scalable and flexible framework for the
simulation of the device layer in smart-city applications.<br />
(August 2018 - January 2019)</p>
<h3>Discrete-event modeling for Industrial IoT applications</h3>
<p>As a part of an <i>Energy-efficient assembly lines</i> project at RBCCPS, the project 
involved building simulation models of the assembly line for prediction, optimization
and real-time monitoring in an industrial Internet-of-Things framework. An open-source
simulator for an SMT-PCB assembly line with GUI support, developed as a part of this project
is available <a href="https://github.com/NehaKaranjkar/IIoT_RBCCPS/">here</a>.<br />
PI: Prof. Rajesh Sundaresan, IISc Bangalore<br />
(August 2017 - August 2018)</p>
