=== About This Course
	- This is an undergraduate LAB accompanying cs 348 (Computer Networks). The goal of this 
	lab is to understand and become familiar with common Networking tools, and be able to 
	design, build, simulate and test some software components of computer networks such
	as reliable data transfer protocols, routing algorithms and networked applications.
